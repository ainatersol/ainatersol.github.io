Welcome! I'm Aina Tersol, a dedicated Machine Learning Data Scientist passionate about making machine learning more accessible and interpretable, so that individuals and organizations alike can learn and implement effective machine learning solutions.
With a robust engineering and development background, I thrive in managing the full lifecycle of ML modelsâ€”from conceptualizing proofs of concept to solving real-world problems in production environments.

### What I Do
I specialize in the architecture and optimization of machine learning pipelines, emphasizing model inference, deployment, and management. My goal is to create robust AI solutions that are not only innovative but also practical for widespread use. I believe in a hands-on approach, where continuous learning and adaptation are key to success.

### My Approach
My approach to machine learning is deeply rooted in practicality. I enjoy building and iterating on proofs of concept, transforming theoretical knowledge into actionable solutions. This process not only challenges me intellectually but also provides tangible benefits to the community and industries I work with.

### Why Machine Learning? 
For me, machine learning is not just about algorithms and data; it's about making a positive impact. By developing tools that are understandable and usable, I aim to bridge the gap between complex AI technologies and everyday applications, making it easier for others to leverage the power of AI.

Feel free to explore my projects, publications, and the work experiences that have shaped my career so far. I'm always open to discussing AI, technology, and potential collaborations!


## Personal Life
In my personal life, I share a deep bond with my partner, Alexander, who is also a passionate Machine Learning Scientist. We both have a strong focus on research, but while I strive to make machine learning accessible, Alexander enjoys going deep into the theoretical aspects of AI. This synergy not only strengthens our relationship but also enhances our professional endeavors.

Together, we actively participate in the local machine learning community, contributing to discussions, attending meetups, and collaborating on research projects. Our shared passion for AI and machine learning continually inspires us to push the boundaries of what we can achieve both individually and as a team.
