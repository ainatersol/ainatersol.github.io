Welcome! I'm Aina Tersol, a dedicated Machine Learning Data Scientist passionate about making machine learning more accessible and interpretable, so that individuals and organizations alike can learn and implement effective machine learning solutions.
With a robust engineering and development background, I thrive in managing the full lifecycle of ML models—from conceptualizing proofs of concept to solving real-world problems in production environments.

### What I Do
I specialize in the architecture and optimization of machine learning pipelines, from model inference and deployment to data management. A big part of my work involves the intersection of UX and AI—designing systems that support the full data lifecycle, from building the right queues and workflows to acquire high-quality data, all the way through to implementing production solutions. My goal is to create robust AI systems that are not only innovative but also practical for widespread use. I believe in a hands-on approach, where continuous learning and adaptation are key to success.

### My Approach
My approach to machine learning is deeply rooted in practicality. I enjoy building and iterating on proofs of concept, transforming theoretical knowledge into actionable solutions. This process not only challenges me intellectually but also provides tangible benefits to the community and industries I work with.

### Why Machine Learning? 
For me, machine learning is not just about algorithms and data; it's about making a positive impact. By developing tools that are understandable and usable, I aim to bridge the gap between complex AI technologies and everyday applications, making it easier for others to leverage the power of AI.

Feel free to explore my projects, publications, and the work experiences that have shaped my career so far. I'm always open to discussing AI, technology, and potential collaborations!


## Personal Life
I love art and all sorts of crafts. Sewing and cooking are how I unwind—there's something grounding about working with my hands after a day of code and models. I'm trying to get involved in community projects that can leverage my skills, and I'm always open to discussing those opportunities.
